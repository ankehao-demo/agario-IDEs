1. Run 'git status' to see all the files that have been changed.
2. For each changed file (ONE AT A TIME):
    a) Check below standards
    b) Provide a summary of any potential violations. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES
    c) Wait for the user to provide feedback or ask to continue BEFORE MOVING TO THE NEXT FILE

For each file, you should be checking:
 - compliance with java-style-guide.md rule
 - Ensure there are no exposed secrets or otherwise confidential information
 - Ensure frontend changes are compliant with general accessibility standards
